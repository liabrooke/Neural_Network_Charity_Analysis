# Overview of the Analaysis: Neural Network Charity
### Purpose
###### Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit network, enlisted our help to create a binary classifier that can determine which applicants will be successful if Alphabet Soup provides them funding.

### Results
##### Data Preprocessing
* ###### What variables are consideredthe target(s) for your model?
* ###### What variables are considered to be the features for your model?
* ###### What variables are neither targets nor features and should be removed from the input data?
##### Complining, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* ###### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and hwy?
* ###### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* ###### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
